# PPE Mask 
An adaptor that enables the addition of an HME filter to a widely available snorkelling full face mask.

We have completely redesigned this adaptor from the original above. 

* Compact and faster to print
* No hard corners, very smooth and therefore easier to clean
* Remove the embossed logo (props to the original team but this isn't needed and makes it more difficult to sterilise)
* Redesign filter connector to make a tighter seal

Subea Easy Breathe version : 
* Lip at the snorkel connector that wraps around the O ring

Leukathea version (chinese snorkel):
* Slight raised lips on the inside that surround the rubber gasket

# Printer Settings

* PETG or PET filament

* 0.2 layer height, 20% infill (we used gyroid but any infill pattern will probably be fine)
* 4 perimeters - this is important as the clip section needs to be solid
* 0.45 extrusion width
* 5 solid layers bottom
* Orientation - print so the circular narrow section is on the bottom, clip at the top

### Steril Handling notes

* Use Nitrile gloves.
* Clean with 70% isopropyl alcohol, or soap and water. Put in sealed bag.
