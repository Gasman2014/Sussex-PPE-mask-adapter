Our version is available here as an STL file. Original Fusion360 / STP files can be accessed here : https://a360.co/2wnvfQ1 

We have re-made the original model in Fusion360 as the original didn't seem to fit the snorkel masks we have. 

Changes from the original : 
* Move the slot in the clip 3mm towards the snorkel (away from the model) 
* Remove the embossed logo (props to the original team but this isn't needed and makes it more difficult to sterilise)
* Smooth out several hard edges on the inside to make the adaptor easier to clean

# Printer Settings

* PETG or PET filament

* 0.2 layer height, 20% infill (we used gyroid but any infill pattern will probably be fine)
* 6 perimeters - this is important as the clip section needs to be solid
* 5 solid layers bottom
* Orientation - print so the circular narrow section is on the bottom, clip at the top

### Steril Handling notes

* Use Nitrile gloves.
* Clean with 70% isopropyl alcohol, or soap and water. Put in sealed bag.
