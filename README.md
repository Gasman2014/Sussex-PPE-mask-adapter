# PPE Mask 
An adaptor that enables the addition of an HME filter to a widely available snorkelling full face mask.

We have completely redesigned this adaptor from the original above. 

* Compact and faster to print
* No hard corners, very smooth and therefore easier to clean
* Remove the embossed logo (props to the original team but this isn't needed and makes it more difficult to sterilise)
* Redesign filter connector to make a tighter seal

Subea Easy Breathe version : 
* Lip at the snorkel connector that wraps around the O ring

Leucothea version (chinese snorkel):
* Slight raised lips on the inside that surround the rubber gasket

# Printer Settings

* PETG or PET filament

* 0.2 layer height, 20% infill (we used gyroid but any infill pattern will likely be acceptable)
* 4 perimeters - this is important as the clip section needs to be solid
* 0.45 extrusion width
* 5 solid layers bottom
* Orientation - print so the circular narrow section is on the bottom, clip at the top

Use vaseline to make the seals airtight. Note that the version information is etched onto the model to be an aid when slicing; it is not deep enough to be visible when printed (unless your 3D Printer is high resolution). 

# TOLERANCES

Please ensure that your 3D printer is dimensionally accurate and use callipers to measure your adaptor.

# SAFETY NOTES

In our testing, we found there to be some inconsistency as to whether the front valve lets in air. You need to do your own testing on your masks. More information here : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-w77MgJVmBnwxqWTOj560orCjCVPEXkqCZU_f2qz8c/edit

### Sterile Handling notes

* Use Nitrile gloves.
* Clean with 70% isopropyl alcohol, or soap and water. Put in sealed bag.
