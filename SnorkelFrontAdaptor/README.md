# Subea snorkel front face medical filter adaptor 

An experimental design that enables the addition of an HME filter to the front valve of a Subea EasyBreathe snorkel, to be used in addition to the filter adaptors fitted to the top of the mask.  

NB This is very much a proof-of-concept design that requires further development.

The adaptor comprises three parts, the inner back plate on the inside of the mask, the adaptor between the mask and the filter, and the valve adaptor on the other side of the filter.

It requires a standard 25mm x 2.5mm o-ring, an M3 threaded insert and a M3 x 10mm screw.

The insert is placed inside the adaptor, and the screw comes through the back plate on the inside and out of the front of the snorkel.

The valve adaptor goes on the other side of the filter.

# Design notes

The inner back plate has struts that are easily broken, until we can develop the design further, we urge that you treat these gently, or else print the back plate with an SLA resin printer. 

# Printer Settings

* PETG filament recommended. 

Use vaseline to make the seals airtight. 

### Steril Handling notes

* Use Nitrile gloves.
* Clean with 70% isopropyl alcohol, or soap and water. Put in sealed bag.
